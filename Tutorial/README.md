# Tutorial

### And some advice

This will (soon) be a tutorial of how I am approaching buffer overflows,

I see a lot of people who use msf-pattern (offset and create) which, I begun with, to get a grasp of it years ago,
but I mean it's quick and easy, but it isn't very "pedagogic" or, "the way to learn"

(Of course, it's good to know how to use tools like that)

### But since I am going for OSCP oon (9th may) I chose this is not how I will do it.
(Even if I know what the tool does)

I will improve this one (this vulnerserver exploit) to not use msf-pattern
(Not to limit myself, or anyone else - but,

I am better safe than sorry. ESPECIALLY when it comes to infosecurity (not specifically oscp, but it's included))

And, especially for someone that will **go OSCP** - If I quote some text from the OSCP-Exam-Guide:

"The primary objective of the OSCP exam is to evaluate your skills in identifying and exploiting vulnerabilities, not in automating the process."
https://help.offensive-security.com/hc/en-us/articles/360040165632-OSCP-Exam-Guide

Therefore, I will make everything (that, in *practice* can be made (without years of work obviously, since the exam is 24 hours)) from scratch.

Now, why Am I writing this to (maybe) someone who isn't going to go OSCP?

It's because, automation tools is good, but it's **even better** to know how the tool works,
and *especially* what it does, and why it does it (the way it does certain things) and so on.

It's also quite a good way to learn.
And, I would say - it's considered good practice.

Auto-tools - if one does not know anything about them, they can be **dangerous** since, one has not even checked the source or - the reviews of it.
Especially if one just follows tutorials and not actually even trying to grasp the content of it.

Just advice from myself! No one needs to follow this. Or agree. Remember, we all have our own ways of doing things.
